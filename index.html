            "...when the language entered specification and standardization with ECMA, SUN (now
            oracle) kept the trademark to the name java, [...] the name javascript could not be
            used. The name then fell back on the name of the committee responsible for standardizing
            it (ecma) and gradually became known as ECMA script."

            As such, the members of the Technical committee 39 are organizations, not individuals,

            They meet on a regular basis and review proposals that are made for the language. They

            1) You will need to find a TC39 Champion (some member on the committee) to pick up your idea and presents it. You can get into this process
            in a few ways, IRC is a good place to start. Check out the Github repo for more info! <a

          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            1) you will need a demo. This can take the form of a polyfill or similar
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            2) you will need to write a spec. A spec defines the feature to be implemented in
            abstract terms. There are several spec languages, and ECMA Script uses one of them
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">

            It is expected at this point that all Semantics, syntax, and API are fully described by
            this stage. The solution should be considered complete at this point.

          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            You will also need to write test262 acceptance tests, so that those implementing your
            feature in the future will be able to run them against your tests.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            This is the period in which you will be collecting lots of feedback from users
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            Requires two complete implementations that have passed your acceptance
            tests.

            Now, it is up to browsers and engine writers to implement your feature. It may still be
