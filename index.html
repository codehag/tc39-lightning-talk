            They meet on a regular basis and review proposals that are made for the language. They

            Got an idea? Here is how you start:
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            You will need to find a TC39 Champion (someone on the committee) to pick up your idea and presents it. You can get into this process
            in a few ways. By registering on ECMA international, or via <a
             href="https://esdiscuss.org/">esdiscuss</a>
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            At this stage you need a good idea, not necessarily a demo (yet)

            if your idea isn't rejected, then you can continue working on it!

            Ok. You made it past the first stage, now you need a demo!
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            In this stage you create an initial draft, often with a lot of feedback
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            You will need to create an implementation that shows the proposed behavior, often as a
            polyfill or something similar.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">

            Congratz! you have a Candidate. That means that it now needs input from a LOT of users.
            It needs to go out into the wild. This might be as a browser implementation or similar.
            You need lots of feedback from people who use your new feature.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            You will also need to write test262 acceptance tests, so that those implementing your
            feature in the future will be able to run them against your tests.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            expect critical changes which will probably be suggested by people based on their

          </p>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: 32px">
            Now, it is up to browsers and engine writers to implement your feature. It may still be
